    <h1>CopyResource Annotation</h1>

    <p>
        The CopyResource annotation can be used to apply a new theme to your specifications, tweak the existing styling, or add 
        new css, javascript, images, or other resources.
    </p>
    <p>
		The CopyResource annotation can be applied to all classes in the class hierarchy - each class will be inspected in turn (parent first) 
		for the annotation.  Each annotation will be processed in isolation to others so they will operate independently.  You will need to 
		ensure that there are no conflicts.
	</p>
    
    <p>The annotation has the following options:</p>
	
	<table class="annotationSummary">
	<tr>
		<th align="left">removeDefaultCSS</th><td>remove the default concordion css styling</td>
	</tr>
	
	<tr>		
		<th align="left">sourceFiles</th><td>One or more files to add to the generated specification:
			<ul>
				<li>File name starting with '/' is relative to the root folder</li>
				<li>File not starting with '/' is relative to the class the annotation is applied to</li>
				<li>Supports wild card characters ("/images/*.png", "/css/*.*")</li>
				<li>If no file is found an exception will be thrown</li>
				<li>Will inspect the HTML and remove any links from the head section that contain "concordion.css" or any of the CSS or JavaScript files that have been added</li>
				<li>CSS and JS files are treated a little differently than other files:
					<ul>
						<li>the specifications html will be updated with the correct link (if linked) or content (if embedded)</li>
						<li>CSS is appended to the end of the head section so that any styling will override the default Concordion styles</li>
						<li>any existing links to the resource file will be removed</li>
					</ul>
					All other file types must be added to the specification at design time by whomever is writing the specification.
				</li>
				
			</ul>
