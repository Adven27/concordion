<h1>Field Initialisation in Fixtures With Examples</h1>

<p>When running a specification with examples, a new fixture object is created for each example, including the outer (anonymous) example.</p>
<p>Since this part of the specification is in the outer example, the instance fields should have been created <span c:assertEquals="getCounter()">1</span> time.</p>

<div c:example="example1">
<p>Since this part of the specification is in the first example, the instance fields should have been created <span c:assertEquals="getCounter()">2</span> times.</p>
</div>

<div c:example="example2">
<p>Since this part of the specification is in the second example, the instance fields should have been created <span c:assertEquals="getCounter()">3</span> times.</p>
</div>

<p>Since this part of the specification is in the outer example, the instance fields should have been created <span c:assertEquals="getCounter()">1</span> time.</p>
